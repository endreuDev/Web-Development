# Web-Development
Some of my tests and classes with Web Development

The folder "The Web Developer Bootcamp 2023" focuses on a course on Udemy, instructed by Mr. Colt Steele (https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/).
Attached are all files created on my PC while following the course. Please note that some sites/code may be different from the main project instructed by Mr. Steele
for creativity and experimentation purposes.
